# Project Goals

As of the time of writing (early 2022), this project’s goals are to hold 2 competing ideas in tension:

- Provide tooling compatible with the [Design Tokens W3C spec](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/)
- Take liberties to expand the Design Tokens spec and not be bound to the in-progress spec

For the most part, there’s more overlap with this project and the Design Tokens spec than without. But that may be subject to change as the API evolves.

#### What does the name “Cobalt” mean?

The name ”cobalt” has several meanings. Historically, the blue pigment cobalt (along with ultramarine) has been one of the most elusive and rare colors in painting. But with the commodification of pigments and advancements in paint storage, cobalt is now
widely available to all, and in the process, revolutionized art. Blue pigment was the last “missing piece“ in paint colors. In a similar sense, having an easy-to-use system to manage tokens aims to be the “missing piece” to design management for
applications.

Secondly, cobalt is an element on the periodic table. It’s reflective of how design tokens are in a sense the “elements“ of a design system.

Thirdly, cobalt blue is a reference to a “blueprint”—the founding sketch of your design.
