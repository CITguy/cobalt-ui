# Project Goals

The project goals are subject to change, but currently are encompassed by 3 points:

1. Support the complete and full [W3C Design Tokens CG spec](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format)
2. Maintain a pluggable interface, where users can write their own plugins or the community can contribute plugins
3. Make `tokens.json` syncing from Figma easy and automatable

### What does “Cobalt” mean?

The name ”cobalt” has several meanings. Historically, the blue pigment cobalt (along with ultramarine) has been one of the most elusive and rare colors in painting. But with the commodification of pigments and advancements in paint storage, cobalt is now
widely available to all, and in the process, revolutionized art. Blue pigment was the last “missing piece“ in paint colors. In a similar sense, having an easy-to-use system to manage tokens aims to be the “missing piece” to design management for
applications.

Secondly, cobalt is an element on the periodic table. It’s reflective of how design tokens are in a sense the “elements“ of a design system.

Thirdly, cobalt blue is a reference to a “blueprint”—the founding sketch of your design.
